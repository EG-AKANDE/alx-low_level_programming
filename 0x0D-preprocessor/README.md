# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## Description
This project contains tasks on C preprocessor with coding tasks covering:

	- C program Compilation Process
	- Object-like Macros
	- Macro Arguments
	- Pre Processor Directives in C
	- The C Preprocessor
	- Standard Predefined Macros
	- include guard
	- Common Predefined Macros

## Requirements (Part 1)
### Things you're allowed to do:
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the `root` of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- The only `C` standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You are given `main.c` files, use them.
- All your `header` files should be `include` guarded

## Requirements (Part 2)
### Things you're not allowed to do:
- You are not allowed to use `global variables`.
- You are not allowed to have more than 5 functions per file
- Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden.

## Files
The following files are present in this project:
- `0-object_like_macro.h`: header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
- `0-main.c`: test file for `0-object_like_macro.h`

## Compilation
Files will be compiled using:
`gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main.c <file>.c -o <output file>`
