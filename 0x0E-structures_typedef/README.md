# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
This project contains coding tasks targeted at `structures`, `typedef`, when, why and how to use them. 
It also defines a new type `struct dog` with the members `name`, `age`, and `owner` with other instances built in.

## Requirements (Part 1)
Things you're allowed to do:
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- Have a `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `printf`, `malloc`, `free` and `exit`.
- You are given `main.c` files, use them.
- All your `header files` should be include guarded.

## Requirements (Part 2)
Things you're not allowed to do:
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- You are not allowed more than 5 functions per file

## Files
- `dog.h`: header file that contains the declaration of the `struct dog` structure.
- `0-main.c`: source file that contains an example of how to use the `struct dog` structure.

## Compilation and Usage
To compile the program, run the following command:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <main.c file> -o <output file>`.
