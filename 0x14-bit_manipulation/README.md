# 0x14. `C Language` - `Bit manipulation`

## Description
This project consists of `C` coding tasks that cover `Bit Manipulation`.

## Requirements (Part 1)
### Things you're allowed to do:
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the `root` of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty style`. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- The only `C` standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You are given `main.c` files, use them.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your `header file` called `main.h`
- All your `header files` should be `include` guarded

## Requirements (Part 2)
### Things you're not allowed to do:
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- You are not allowed more than 5 functions per file
- Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden

## Files
        - `0-binary_to_uint.c`: function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
        - `1-print_binary.c`: function that prints the binary representation of a number.
        - `2-get_bit.c`: function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
        - `3-set_bit.c`: function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
        - `4-clear_bit.c`: function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
        - `5-flip_bits.c`: function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
        - `100-get_endianness.c`: function that checks the endianness.
        - `101-password`: password for program.

## Compilation
The files are to be compiled with:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <input file> <output executable>`
