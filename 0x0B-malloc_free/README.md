Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

# Tasks

## Task 0: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char. The function prototype is:

char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c);

# How to Compile
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 *.c -o <output_file>
