## Usage

To compile any of these programs, you can use the following command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <file-name.c> -o <output-name>

For example, to compile `0-strcat.c`, you would run:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-strcat.c -o strcat

To run the program, you can use the following command:
